A processing error led to the publication of incorrect data for 2015/16 for series ANRS and associated series ANRV, ANSI, ANSL, ANSV, ANSY, JW34 and JW37 which are derived from ANRS. These series have now been corrected leading to revisions to tables REC1, PSA10 and Public Sector Finances borrowing by sub-sector, in 2015/16. Measures of net borrowing, net cash requirement and net debt are unaffected by these changes.
