A processing error led to the level of gilts held by the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund (APF) being overstated by £11.0 billion. Gilts held by the APF which reached maturity in September 2016 were not recorded as redeemed leading to the assets of the APF being overstated and, correspondingly, public sector net debt understated. As a result of correcting this error, public sector net debt at the end of September 2016 (Series HF6W) has increased by £11.3 billion or 0.6 percentage points of GDP (Series HF6X). Due to the removal of interest payments to the APF related to these gilts, the public sector net borrowing (Series -J5II) in September 2016 has increased by £18 million and public sector net cash requirement (Series JW38) in September 2016 has increased by £221 million. Tables PSA1, 2, 3, 4, 7A, 8D, 9 and REC1 have been updated to reflect the corrected dataset.
