Because the “erratics” series is volatile, a total trade series that excludes erratics may provide a better guide to the emerging trade picture. We will therefore include a total trade in goods and services excluding erratics series in the next release to supplement the trade in goods excluding erratics series already available.\nThe correction of the erratics series will also affect the quarterly Balance of Payments from Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2015 to Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2016, and it will change some expenditure components of the Quarterly National Accounts for the same period. There is no impact on total GDP, as the corrections to components of trade and the acquisitions less disposals of valuables offset each other. However, the composition of the expenditure estimate of GDP will change from what was published in the second estimate of GDP Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2016.\n\nThe correction will be incorporated into the Quarterly National Accounts and Balance of Payments on 23 December, as part of the Quarter 3 2016 release.\n\nThe correction will be incorporated into the next annual Blue Book and Pink Book publication during October 2017, which is the next available opportunity. Some analysis and ad-hoc tables providing the impact on geographic tables within chapter 9 of the Pink Book (current account geographic tables) will be issued in early 2017. This analysis will include all current account annual revisions published as part of the Balance of Payments Quarter 3 2016 release. \n\nThe appended table of key aggregates of UK Trade and Balance of Payments gives an indication of the impact of correcting this error. This incorporates the use of some actual data in place of a forecast for September 2016. However, other data revisions to trade data will be included in the UK Trade release on 9 December 2016. \n\nWe apologise for any inconvenience.\n\n|  | Trade balance - published | Trade balance - indicative new values | Revision | \n| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n|  |  |  |  | \n| 2015 | -38674 | -31933 | 6741 | \n|  |  |  |  | \n| 2015 Q1 | -9938 | -10420 | -482 | \n| Q2 | -8,183 | -7,219 | 964 | \n| Q3 | -9,976 | -8,102 | 1,874 | \n| Q4 | -10,577 | -6,192 | 4,385 | \n| 2016 Q1 | -9,975 | -9,415 | 560 | \n| Q2 | -12,691 | -9,929 | 2,762 | \n| Q3 | -11,047 | -17,001 | -5,954 | \n|  |  |  |  | \n| 2015 Jan | -2,940 | -3,482 | -542 | \n| Feb | -3,590 | -3,889 | -299 | \n| Mar | -3,408 | -3,049 | 359 | \n| Apr | -2,977 | -2,929 | 48 | \n| May | -2,164 | -2,044 | 120 | \n| Jun | -3,042 | -2,246 | 796 | \n| Jul | -4,722 | -3,526 | 1,196 | \n| Aug | -3,338 | -2,578 | 760 | \n| Sep | -1,916 | -1,998 | -82 | \n| Oct | -3,870 | -3,852 | 18 | \n| Nov | -3,986 | -1,968 | 2,018 | \n| Dec | -2,721 | -372 | 2,349 | \n| 2016 Jan | -4,442 | -1,423 | 3,019 | \n| Feb | -3,587 | -3,454 | 133 | \n| Mar | -1,946 | -4,538 | -2,592 | \n| Apr | -2,983 | -3,918 | -935 | \n| May | -4,056 | -1,797 | 2,259 | \n| Jun | -5,652 | -4,214 | 1,438 | \n| Jul | -2,058 | -4,201 | -2,143 | \n| Aug | -3,768 | -6,211 | -2,443 | \n| Sep | -5,221 | -6,589 | -1,368 | \n\n<br>\n\n|  | Current account balance - published | Current account balance - indicative new values | Revision | Current account balance as % of GDP - published | Current account balance as % of GDP - indicative new values | \n| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  | \n| 2015 | -100,167 | -93,426 | 6741 | -5.4 | -5.0 | \n|  |  |  |  |  |  | \n| 2015 Q1 | -24,972 | -25,454 | -482 | -5.4 | -5.5 | \n| Q2 | -21,964 | -21,000 | 964 | -4.7 | -4.5 | \n| Q3 | -20,490 | -18,616 | 1,874 | -4.4 | -4.0 | \n| Q4 | -32,741 | -28,356 | 4,385 | -7.0 | -6.0 | \n| 2016 Q1 | -26,999 | -26,439 | 560 | -5.7 | -5.6 | \n| Q2 | -28,684 | -25,922 | 2,762 | -5.9 | -5.4 | ","type":"correction"},{"date":"2016-12-14T10:34:35.676Z","markdown":"An error has been found in the UK Trade in goods by classification of product by activity time series dataset.
